## Privacy & Security

- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in Chrome's storage
- No data is sent to any server except OpenAI's API
- DOM and console data is only collected when you explicitly ask questions
- Conversation history is stored locally and can be cleared anytime

## Troubleshooting

**Extension won't load:**
- Make sure all files are in the same directory
- Ensure you've created the icon files using `create-icons.html`
- Check that Developer Mode is enabled in Chrome

**Voice input not working:**
- Grant microphone permissions when prompted
- Voice recognition requires an internet connection
- Only works in browsers that support Web Speech API

**AI not responding:**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct and has credits
- Check your internet connection
- Look for error messages in the chat interface

**Can't access page DOM/console:**
- Refresh the page after installing the extension
- Some pages (like chrome:// URLs) restrict extension access
- Check the browser console for any errors
